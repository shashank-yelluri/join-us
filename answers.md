## Let's hack!

1. **Find the longest word in a string.**
```
// Given The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog is the input to your function, it should return jumped.

const findMaxLengthWord = (sentence) => {
    let maxWordLength = 0;
    let result = "";
    for (let word of sentence.split(" ")) {
        if (word.length > maxWordLength) {
            maxWordLength = word.length;
            result = word;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

2. **Repeat a string n times.**
```
// If abc and 3 are the arguments to your function, it shoudl return abcabcabc

const repeatWord = (word, noOfTimes) => {
    return word.repeat(noOfTimes);
}
```

3. **Remove duplicates in an array**
```
// If [1, 20, 3, 1, 3, 3] is the input to your function, it should return [1, 20, 3]

const removeDuplicates = (numbersArray) => {
    return [...new Set(numbersArray)];
}
```

4. **Remove falsy values**
```
// If [42, "everything", "", 2, false, "everything"] is the input to your function, it should return [42, "everything", 2, "everything"]

const filterFalsyValues = (valuesArray) => {
    return arr.filter(value => value);
}
```

5. **Truncate a string**
```
// If 'Absolute victory' and 3 are the inputs to your function, it should return Abs...
// Note: Assuming that 3 dots are also resemblence of the input 3. (May be i am overthinking, but implementing it for the safer side.)

const truncateString = (word, trimLength) => {
    return `${word.substring(0, trimLength)}${'.'.repeat(trimLength)}`;
}
```
